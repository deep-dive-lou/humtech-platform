# Offer Slots (v1)

When offering slots:
- check calendar availability via calendar adapter
- filter by user constraints (day/time_window/explicit_time)
- choose exactly 2 slots (see skill: slot_selection)
- store last_offer in conversation.context including diagnostics (calendar_check)
- create outbound message asking the user to pick 1 or 2
